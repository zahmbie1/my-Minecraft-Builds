# my-Minecraft-Builds
My minceraft builds! :D
<p> So, to walk around in any of my builds, you have to get the world file from releases. You then have to put the world folder in the place where all the world folders are (mostl ikely "worlds"). Put the world folder there. Open minecraft, and my world should be there :D</p>
